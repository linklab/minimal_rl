# LINK-minimalRL-pytorch

Implementations of basic RL algorithms with minimal lines of codes! (PyTorch based)

* Each algorithm is complete within a single file.

* Length of each file is up to 100~150 lines of codes.

* Every algorithm can be trained within 30 seconds, even without GPU.

* Envs are fixed to "CartPole-v1". You can just focus on the implementations.

## Dependencies
1. PyTorch
2. OpenAI GYM
  - conda install -c conda-forge gym-all
